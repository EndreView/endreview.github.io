Summer hot sun will sunburn the delicate skin of the baby, especially their eye structure is very sensitive to light, strong sunlight will seriously damage the child's vision, so the sunscreen homework must be done. 

Recently, I checked a lot of information on the Internet, including some recommendations from the Mom Mutual Help Group, and weighed all the factors and finally selected the [Bafiators](https://amzn.to/2Mq3eyl). The weight of the Babiators glasses is very light, I think **its outstanding advantage is that it can be spread flat 180 degrees**, given that my baby often takes the glasses down and bends it.

In addition, I have summarized some of the other advantages of this glasses, as follows:

- Equipped with the highest UV400 factor, which provides 100% UVA & UVB protection.
- I used to think that infants and young children may not like to wear sunglasses because of the uncomfortable foreign body sensation. However, the Babiators are very light, the legs are very soft and have a certain curvature, which creates a good coverage and does not stick to the cheeks.
- The babies of the libido period will stuff into their mouths, so I especially value the materials of the sunglasses. The Babiators do not contain BPA harmful substances and are very safe. In addition, the impact resistance of this PC lens is 12 times that of ordinary lenses, so I don't have to worry that my baby will get hurt by the lens.
- It can be pinched and twisted at any angle without deformation.
- I think the shape of B's sunglasses is very good, many stars will wear it to their cute baby.
- Available in a wide range of colors.

Babiators are known as the safest baby sunglasses in the United States. The founders themselves are pilots, and many celebrity babies are wearing this brand. And the after-sales policy is very good, damaged replaced & lost renewed.

I bought a blue sunglasses for my little baby at [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Mq3eyl). Remarks: Regarding the size, there are two choices of 0-2 years old and 3-5 years old. This depends on the specific baby's head circumference.
